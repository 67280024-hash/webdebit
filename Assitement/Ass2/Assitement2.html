    <h2>How to Make Pad Ka Prao : Step by Step </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1.Slice green cayenne peppers. Peel the garlic. Pound chilies and garlic** in a mortar and pestle (if you
            don’t have a mortar and pestle, just put them in a zip-lock bag and pound them with a heavy stuff or knife).
            They should be fine enough to give you the oils and flavors.</li>

        <li>2.Heat a pan on medium high heat. Add oil to the pan. When the oil is hot enough, add the chilies and
            garlic. Stir-fry until they get fragrant. Add the green cayenne peppers.</li>
        <li>3.Turn the heat up higher. Add the meat to the pan. Stir-fry the meat for 5-10 minutes (depending on the
            amount of meat) or until it’s about cooked. If it starts getting dry, add small amount of water(a tiny bit).
        </li>

        <li>4.Add fish sauce, (mushroom) soy sauce, sugar, oyster sauce and chicken bouillon(optional). Keep stirring
            until it’s mixed well. Taste and seasoning as necessary.</li>
        <li>5.Toss holy basil into the pan and fold it into the meat. Don’t cook it for too long. Now it’s ready to be
            served!</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Pad Krapow option</h3>
    <p>Pad Krapow doesn’t need meat at all the dish is incredibly flexible, and the choice of protein can completely
        change the flavor, aroma, and texture. If you prefer a traditional style that highlights the fragrance of
        garlic, chili, and holy basil, ground pork or ground chicken are the classic choices. They absorb sauce well and
        create a balanced, savory base. Ground beef gives a deeper, richer flavor for those who enjoy stronger tastes.
        Crispy pork belly has become very popular because it adds a crunchy texture and a naturally rich aroma that
        elevates the whole dish. Seafood options like shrimp or squid bring a natural sweetness and a lighter, fresher
        profile while still pairing beautifully with basil and chili..</p>
